# 👋 Hi, I'm Ghulam Ahmed

🎯 **Flutter Developer | Mobile App Developer**

I'm a passionate Flutter developer with a strong foundation in building high-performance, scalable mobile apps. I enjoy transforming ideas into real-world applications using Flutter, Firebase, and REST APIs. I follow clean architecture (MVVM/MVC) and leverage state management tools like GetX and Provider to write maintainable and efficient code.
